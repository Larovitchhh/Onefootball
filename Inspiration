### Notes on Customization
- **Repository Name**: Replace `onefootball-fan-app` with your preferred name (e.g., `onefootball-stats`, `onefootball-community`).
- **Placeholder Image**: The banner image URL (`https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=OneFootball+Fan+App`) is a placeholder. Create a custom banner using tools like Canva or Figma and upload it to the repository (e.g., in an `assets/` folder).
- **API Integration**: OneFootball's API may not be publicly available. If itâ€™s not, mention alternative APIs like [Football-Data.org](https://www.football-data.org/) or [SportRadar](https://www.sportradar.com/) in the `README.md`.
- **Your Details**: Update the `Contact` section with your GitHub username, email, and Twitter handle.
- **License**: The `README.md` references an MIT License. Ensure you add a `LICENSE` file to the repository if you choose this (GitHub can auto-generate one during repository creation).
- **Contributing Guidelines**: If you want contributors, create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with detailed instructions.

### Optional Enhancements
- **Add a Logo or Screenshots**: Upload a project logo or app screenshots to the repository and link them in the `README.md` (e.g., `![Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)`).
- **GitHub Actions**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing or deployment.
- **Badges**: Add badges to the `README.md` for build status, license, or coverage using tools like [Shields.io](https://shields.io/).
  Example:
